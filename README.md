## Directory and File Details

- **`src/main/java/com/example/`**: Contains the main Java source code for the application.

  - **`controller/`**: Houses controller classes that handle HTTP requests and direct them to appropriate services or views.

  - **`model/`**: Includes entity classes representing the application's data models, corresponding to database tables.

  - **`repository/`**: Contains repository interfaces for data access operations, typically extending Spring Data JPA interfaces.

  - **`service/`**: Hosts service classes that contain business logic and act as intermediaries between controllers and repositories.

  - **`CrudAppApplication.java`**: The main class that bootstraps and launches the Spring Boot application.

- **`src/main/resources/`**: Holds application resources and configuration files.

  - **`application.properties`**: Configuration file for setting up database connections, server ports, and other application-level settings.

  - **`templates/`**: Contains Thymeleaf templates for rendering the user interface.

    - **`create.html`**: Template for creating new data entries.

    - **`edit.html`**: Template for editing existing data entries.

    - **`list.html`**: Template for displaying a list of data entries.

- **`src/test/java/com/example/CrudAppApplicationTests.java`**: Contains unit tests for the application to ensure functionality and reliability.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked in version control.

- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file that manages project dependencies, build configuration, and plugins.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot Integration**: Simplifies application setup with embedded server and dependency management.

- **MySQL Database**: Utilizes MySQL for persistent data storage, configured via `application.properties`.

- **Spring Security**: Implements authentication and authorization to secure the application.

- **Thymeleaf Templates**: Provides dynamic HTML content rendering for the user interface.

- **CRUD Functionality**: Enables creating, reading, updating, and deleting operations on data entries.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the project to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JariAbbas01/Spring-Boot---MySQL--Localhost----Spring-Security.git
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**: Ensure MySQL is installed and running. Create a database for the application and update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials.

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and use Maven to build the application.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the application.

**Note**: Ensure that the necessary dependencies are specified in the `pom.xml` file, including Spring Boot Starter Web, Spring Boot Starter Data JPA, Spring Boot Starter Security, and the MySQL Connector.

This setup provides a foundational structure for a Spring Boot application with integrated security and database management, facilitating further development and customization.
